//! Class for managing body content to be accepted via PUBLISH or provided in NOTIFY requests
/*! This class is basically a database that is used to store and retrieve
 *  content (i.e. SIP Event state bodies).  This class does not actually
 *  touch or process SIP messages.  It is used by other classes and applications
 *  to store and retrieve content related to SIP SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY and
 *  PUBLISH requests.  The resourceId and eventTypeKey have no symmantics.
 *  It is up to the application or event package to decide what the 
 *  resourceId and eventTypeKey look like.  A suggested default is to
 *  use:  <userId>@<hostname>[:port] as provided in the SUBSCRIBE or
 *  PUBLISH request URI.  It is suggested that host be the domainname
 *  not the specific IP address.  It is also suggested the SIP event
 *  type token be used (without any event header parameters) as the
 *  eventTypeKey.  Only in special cases where the content varies
 *  based upon an event parameter, should the parameter(s) be include
 *  included in the eventTypeKey.
 *
 * \par Put Event State In
 *  Applications put Event state information for a specific resourceId
 *  and eventTypeKey into the SipPublishContentMgr via the publish method.
 *
 * \par Retrieve Event State
 *  Applications retrieve published content type via the getContent
 *  method.
 *
 * \par Remove Event State
 * All event state information for a resource Id and event type key can
 * can be removed via the unpublish method.  The content associated
 * with the keys is passed back so the application can destroy the
 * content.
 *
 * \par Default Event State
 * It is possible to define a default event state for an event type key.
 * This default content is provided in the getContent method if no
 * content was provided for the specific resource Id.  Default content
 * is set via the publishDefault method.
